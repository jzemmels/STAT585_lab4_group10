```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(maps)
liquor <- read_csv("data/story-sales/Iowa_Liquor_Sales-Story.csv")
```

Separate the lat/long data:

```{r}
small.df <- small.df %>%
  mutate(coord.data = str_extract(Store.Location, "\\(.*\\)"),
         lat = str_extract(coord.data, "\\(.*,"),
         lon = str_extract(coord.data, ",.*\\)")) %>%
  mutate(lat = str_extract(lat, "[0-9\\.-]{1,}"),
         lon = str_extract(lon, "[0-9\\.-]{1}"))
```

County had both "Story" and "STORY"
```{r}
liquor <- liquor %>%
  mutate(county = "Story")
```

Story county map so that we can plot the lat/long of all of Story county.
```{r}
county <- map("county","iowa.story")
```

```{r}
countyMap <- data.frame(lat=county$x,long=county$y) %>% na.omit()
write_csv(countyMap,path = "data/storyCountyMap.csv",col_names = TRUE)
countyMap %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=lat,y=long)) +
  geom_path()
```
